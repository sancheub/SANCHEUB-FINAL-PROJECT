# ULISES-SANCHEZ-FINAL-PROJECT
Bernardini Gallery
Art Gallery and Auction House

This project is about the rebuild of an existing web site.
Today this art gallery exposes its artwork on a web page but it has niether manteinace nor updates. This auction house offers all of them for selling directly over the webpage via Paypal. 
Auctions are done via Whatsapp, out of the webpage. 

This site has a huge opportunity to improve on its design and functionality, specially by working the auctions through the site.
